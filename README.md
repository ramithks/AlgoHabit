## Data Model (Brief)
Topic (id, label, week, category, cheatSheetRef) + progress fields (status, lastTouched, dailyNotes, xp flags) stored locally (per user) in versioned localStorage.

## Status Flow

Button cycles: Not Started ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Complete ‚Üí Skipped ‚Üí ‚Ä¶
Skipped remains visible (cannot silently drop) preventing unnoticed omissions.

## Streak & XP
Daily activity maintains streak; 1+ day gap resets. XP awards on first in‚Äëprogress & completion per topic; level curve non‚Äëlinear.

## Weekly Review
Progress counts, remaining topics callouts, simple review suggestions.

## Notifications
In-tab (service worker assisted) reminders only; no server push.

## Mock Leaderboard
Simple points (complete=10, in-progress=3) ‚Äì placeholder for future backend.

## Tech
React + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, date-fns, Service Worker (local only), localStorage (versioned, migratable).

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Implemented Highlights
- Level curve + progress ring & XP delta pulse
- Achievements toast + (optional) confetti
- Focus mode & command palette (‚åò/Ctrl+K)
- Timestamps, contextual suggestions
- Import / Export JSON (Settings)
- 8‚Äëweek activity heatmap (streak intensity)
- Daily schedule generator (learn / reinforce / review cadence)
- Auto deploy via GitHub Actions ‚Üí gh-pages

## Roadmap (Short)
- Spaced repetition & retention heatmap
- Pomodoro / quiet hours
- Achievement tiers & combo multipliers
- Reduced motion & high contrast / themes
- PWA offline support
- Shareable snapshot card

## Deployment
GitHub Actions builds & publishes to `gh-pages` on push to `main` (base `/AlgoHabit/`).

## Data Portability
Settings ‚Üí Data: Export (JSON snapshot) & Import (restore entire state).

## Activity Heatmap
8-week contribution-style grid; greener = deeper recent streak cluster.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut       | Action               |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| ‚åò/Ctrl + K     | Open command palette |
| Esc            | Close palette        |
| Focus Mode Btn | Toggle focus mode    |

## Storage Keys (Version 2)

| Purpose        | Key                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Topics         | dsa-habit-progress-v1     |
| Streak         | dsa-habit-streak-v1       |
| Last Active    | dsa-habit-last-active     |
| XP             | dsa-habit-xp-v1           |
| Achievements   | dsa-habit-achievements-v1 |
| Schema Version | dsa-habit-version         |

## Accessibility & UX Principles

- Clear status buttons (aria-label on cycle)
- High contrast dark baseline
- Motion guarded with `motion-safe`
- Gradual introduction of semantic headings & focus indicators

## Database Technology Recommendation

üìã **[View Complete Database Recommendation](./DATABASE_RECOMMENDATION.md)**

**Summary**: For production deployment and multi-device sync, we recommend **PostgreSQL** as the database technology. The current localStorage implementation is excellent for the MVP, but PostgreSQL provides:

- **Data Persistence**: Reliable storage across devices and sessions
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Access your progress from anywhere
- **Advanced Analytics**: Complex queries for progress insights
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple users and future features

**Key Benefits**:
- Strong data integrity with ACID compliance
- Excellent support for time-series data (streaks, daily notes)
- JSON fields for flexible metadata storage
- Rich ecosystem and cloud hosting options

üìñ **[Implementation Guide](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Complete technical roadmap for migrating from localStorage to PostgreSQL with code examples and deployment strategies.

## Current Architecture (localStorage)

The app currently uses browser localStorage for all data persistence:

- ‚úÖ **Perfect for MVP**: Zero backend complexity
- ‚úÖ **Fast & Responsive**: Instant data access
- ‚ùå **Single Device**: Data doesn't sync across devices
- ‚ùå **Data Loss Risk**: Browser storage can be cleared

## Future Architecture (PostgreSQL + API)

The recommended production architecture includes:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (unchanged)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend + database)
